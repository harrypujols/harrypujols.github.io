    This was harrypujols.com from 2014-2024, meant to be only a temporary
    solution until I had time between projects to set up a different site. It
    lasted 10 years (at least one CTO liked it enough to give me the job).

    This was harrypujols.com from 2009-2014 (and the first repo I saved in
    Github). It was originally hosted in some Mac service for static sites, I
    think it was called iTools. My purpose was to make something "future
    proof", and guess what? The Flash version of the same idea has been lost
    in time.

    There are some sites that give you the formula to find your alchemy zodiac
    sign, but this is the only calculator in the Web (at the time of this
    writing). Originally launched in 2018 and relaunched in 2021.

    Originally created to work for a proprietary CMS where I couldn't add any
    scripts to the templates. Funny that now HTML and CSS can do most of these
    tricks without this library.

    Everybody's videogame career has to start somewhere. Originally launched
    in 2012, relaunched in 2014. The stack I used is so old, I may not revisit
    this again.
