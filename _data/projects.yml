    This was harrypujols.com from 2014-2024. Harry meant it to be just a temporary solution until he had time to build something else, but it stuck around for 10 years. At least one CTO liked it enough to hire him on the spot.

    Harry's site from 2009-2014 (and the first repo he saved on Github). It was originally hosted on some old Mac service for static sites he thinks it was called iTools. He wanted to make something "future proof," and well, the Flash version of this idea is now lost to time.

    There are a few sites that tell you about your alchemy zodiac sign, but Harry's is the only calculator on the web where you can find it (at least when he wrote this). He first launched it in 2018 and relaunched it in 2021.

    The number one game about taking a number one. Harry launched this in 2014 using the very first version of Vue.js.

    Harry originally made this for a proprietary CMS where he couldn't add any scripts to the templates. It's funnyâ€”nowadays, HTML and CSS can pull off most of these tricks without needing a library like this.

    Everyone's videogame journey has to start somewhere. Harry first launched this in 2012, then relaunched it in 2014. The stack is so old now, he probably won't revisit it again.
