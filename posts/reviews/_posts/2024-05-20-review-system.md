Introducing Roasted Potatoes, the review system that accurately displays every review according by Harry. The reviews are on forms of entertainment, such as, but not limited to:

- Movies
- TV Shows
- Radio Shows and Podcasts
- Rock Music (Harry will limit to only this genre of music, as he's not well-versed nor interested in other types. Maybe Reggae)
- Videogames
- Computer Applications (includes desktop and mobile)
- Books (including comic books, and graphic novels)
- Product Design (could include fashion, if it has artistic merits)
- Advertising
- Architecture

The rank system is based on the best rank system created: Warren Goodrich's [Little Man][little-man-external-link]{:target="\_blank"}, which is self explanatory.

![Three Stars](/assets/img/posts/three-star.png)
![Four Stars](/assets/img/posts/four-star.png)
![Five Stars](/assets/img/posts/five-star.png)

Harry is not a critic, by the way, just an average media consumer that has opinons on things.
