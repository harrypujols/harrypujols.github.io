      J-Lo looks timeless in a crowd-pleasing sci-fi adventure with very decent special effects, considering it's Netflix.

      With the back-and-forth time jumps and edge-of-your-seat finale, the movie itself is a tennis match.

      The soundtrack slaps, the dialog is sharp and funny, but I felt they had more fun making the movie than me watching it.

      High-octane action that hopes to teach you a thing or two about bees, beehives and similar Animal Planet related stuff.

      The epic sci-fi sequel has more worms, more space drugs, more combat, more palace intrigue and a better popcorn bucket.

      Alex Garland's most misleading title since Never Let Me Go. Keeping the story apolitical drained all the depth out of it.

      This movie is evidence the world needs more steampunk sex comedies.

      A lesbian fantasy of sex with a sweaty, veiny, Sendaya look-alike. Roid rage and mullets haven't been this relevant since Con Air.

      This hyper-violent revenge actioner is not for the squeamish, but the stunts are worth watching.

      Netflix darling Millie Bobby Brown spends half the movie chatting with a dragon that wants to eat her.

      The sexyness of the shirtless Swayze 80s version was replaced by UFC bro propaganda.

      ClichÃ© ridden, unfunny and as out-of-place as Sidney Sweeney's attempts at physical comedy.

      The brand biopic is an official thing after 2023's Air, Blackberry, Tetris and Flaming Hot. This time, it's an old-fashioned comedy.

      While Jon Hamm in theory is not perfect to play the character made popular by Chevy Chase, the movie triumphs in all fronts.

      A stealth remake of The Talented Mr Ripley, which by coincidence has a new show on Netflix.
