      J-Lo looks timeless in a crowd-pleasing sci-fi adventure with very decent special effects, considering it's Netflix.

      With the back-and-forth time jumps and edge-of-your-seat finale, the movie itself is a tennis match.

      High-octane action with too many references to the habits of bees and hives.

      The epic sci-fi sequel has more space worms, more battles, more palace intrigue and a better popcorn bucket.

      Alex Garland's most misleading title since Never Let Me Go. Keeping the story apolitical drained all the depth out of it.

      There are not many steampunk sex comedies out there, actually, I think this is the only one.

      A lesbian fantasy of sex with a muscular, veiny, roid-ragey 
      Sendaya look-alike in a world of men with mullets.

      It's sold as John Wick in India, the hyper violence of this revenge flick is not for the squeamish.

      Netflix darling Millie Bobby Brown spends half the movie chatting with a dragon that wants to eat her.

      The sexyness of the shirtless Swayze 80s version was replaced by UFC bro propaganda.

      Sidney Sweeney attempts some physical comedy, a miscalculation of her talents. Charmless, unfunny romantic comedy.

      A competent, old-fashioned comedy, I expect it to age fine in years to come.

      While Jon Hamm in theory is not perfect to play the character made popular by Chevy Chase, the movie triumphs in all fronts.

      A stealth remake of The Talented Mr Ripley, which by coincidence has a new show on Netflix.
