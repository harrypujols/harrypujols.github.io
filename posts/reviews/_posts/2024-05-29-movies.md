      J-Lo looks timeless in a crowd-pleasing sci-fi adventure with very decent special effects, considering it's Netflix.

      With the back-and-forth time jumps and edge-of-your-seat finale, the movie itself is a tennis match.

      High-octane action with more speeches about the habits of bees and hives than an Animal Planet documentary.

      Alex Garland's most misleading title since Never Let Me Go. The feeling that something in this story is missing lingers.

      There are not many steampunk sex comedies out there, actually, I think this is the only one.

      A lesbian fantasy of sex with a muscular, veiny, roid-ragey 
      Sendaya look-alike in a world of men with mullets.

      It's sold as John Wick in India, but the hyper violence of this revenge flick is not for the squeamish.

      Netflix darling Millie Bobby Brown spends half the movie chatting with a dragon that wants to eat her.

      The sexyness of the shirtless Swayze 80s version was replaced by UFC bro propaganda.

      Sidney Sweeney attempts some physical comedy in this charmless, unfunny romantic comedy.

      I did not understand the bad reviews. It's a competent, old-fashioned comedy.

      While Jon Hamm in theory is not perfect to play the character made popular by Chevy Chase, the movie succeeds in all fronts.
