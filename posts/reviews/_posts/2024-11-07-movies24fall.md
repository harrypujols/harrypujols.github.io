      This type of animated film comes too often these days. This one stands above average.

      I can't rate this movie, and I can't think of why people would enjoy this in any way.

      This is the best movie in the series in almost 40 years, and it's still kind of mid.

      This movie didn't know if it wanted to be a sports drama or a heartwarming story of boy finds dog.
