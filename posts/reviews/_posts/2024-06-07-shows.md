      The style-over-substance style of Guy Ritchie works well for this crime comedy (Netflix)

    rating: 4
    sub: Season 1

      I'm afraid people aren't in the mood to watch a leisurely-paced, black-and-white serial killer drama, but if you make it a hit, there's a tease for Season 2. John Malkovich, who played the character Ripley about 20 years ago, makes a cameo (Netflix)

  - name: Baby Reindeer
    rating: 4
    sub: Season 1

      A struggling comedian is haunted by a stalker, captivating lot for a show, even when it loses steam by the middle episodes (Netflix)

  - name: The Last Airbender
    rating: 2

      Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony, then everything changed when M. Night Shyamalan did a terrible film adaptation. This show is an improvement, but that's not saying a lot (Netflix)

  - name: The 3 Body Problem
    rating: 1
    sub: Season 1

      This incoherent mess has more resemblance in quality to the ending of Game of Thrones than its beginning (Netflix)

  - name: Invinsible
    rating: 4
    sub: Season 2

      The comic books have laid out at least the next 6 seasons, but this show isn't rushing it, and the result is impressive (Amazon Prime)

  - name: Shogun
    rating: 5
    sub: Season 1

      The best TV show in a decade, leaving behind the white-savior angle of the 80s adaptation for a delicate game of 4D chess between waring factions. This season will be near-impossible to top, the book's material is already over (FX)

  - name: Curb Your Enthusiasm
    rating: 4
    sub: Season 12

      Consistently funny to the very end. What else can I say? (HBO)

  - name: Severance
    rating: 4
    sub: Season 1

      I missed this show in 2022. My 90s self would have been mind-blown watching John Turturro and Christophen Walken romantically involved (Apple TV)

  - name: Eric
    rating: 2
    sub: Season 1

      A puppeter searching for his missing child in an anachronistic 80s New York City looked promising, but the "unreliable narrator" psychological drama made it a drag (Netflix)
