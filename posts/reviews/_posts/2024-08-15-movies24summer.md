      The more emotions this movie introduces, the less emotions they make me feel.

  - name: Deadpool and Wolverine

      The problem of basing the entire movie on inside jokes is that it leaves a lot of people out of them, and it may age badly in the future.

      It's very hard to follow up one of the greatest films of all time.

      It's been 40 years since the first movie, and it's still the same old dog doing same old tricks.

      What's the point of this movie when you can just watch the 1996 classic?

      Attack The Block, but in France, and with the creepiest spiders ever put on film.

      The premise seems to be losing freshness, it even borrows some clichÃ©s from zombie movies.

      Inglourious Basterds but dumber, but also more fun.

  - name: Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes

      This series keeps releasing one banger after the other. A criminally underrated sci-fi masterpiece.

      Another banger from the X saga. The movie feels and looks old, but the lack of gratuituous boobs breaks the immersion.

  - name: In A Violent Nature

      This year is turning to be a milestone for horror movies. A gory, gruesome update of the slasher sub-genre.

  - name: Late Night With the Devil

      The perfect spooky movie for streaming.

      Sidney Sweeney may have been a puritanic maid in the Handmaid's Tale, but she's not a believable horror-movie nun.

      A campy, unintentionally funny bad movie made with a shoestring budget. I'd watch it again as a play.

      If you asked some advanced AI to make you the quintessential A24 movie, it will come up with something like this.

      A rudimentary serial killer, supernatural horror, saved by Nicolas Cage in drag.

      This film reminds you that grannies are precious, and how can you argue with that?

      A prequel that manages to be above average, but I completely forgot about it after a watch.
