I donâ€™t remember the first time I heard the rules, but they go something like this

> The act of a man picking an open urinal that accomplishes 2 things.
> 
> - He is not standing right next to another man.
> - Anybody else that enters the bathroom will be forced to stand next to another man. [^1]

I took a few hours to put something together based on the rules. I don't remember why I wrote it in coffeescript, maybe I just wanted to test it. I did a few personal projects in Vue.js then, I still like working with that framework. [The result is available here.](http://harrypujols.com/urinal-checkmate/)
