A few years ago I was in a class when we discussed different types of zodiac signs, and turns out we also had an archemical zodiac sign. We read an article that had a formula of how to find your archemical zodiac sign according to birth date. I looked up on Google if there was a free calculator, and turns out, there wasn't.

Now, I don't remember where's the article where I found the formula, and I reserve my right to update this article when I find it. I do not really care about zodiac signs, but with the formula in hand, I decided to make that calculator page myself.

The result can be seen [here][alchemy-link].
