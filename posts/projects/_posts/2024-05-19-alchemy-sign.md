A few years ago I was in a class when we discussed different types of zodiac signs, and turns out we also had an archemical zodiac sign. We read an [article][external-number-link]{:target="\_blank"} that had a formula[^1] of how to find your archemical zodiac sign according to [birth date][another-external-link]{:target="\_blank"}. I looked up on Google if there was a free calculator, and turns out, there wasn't.

I do not really care about zodiac signs, but with the formula in hand, I decided to make that calculator page myself.

The result can be seen [here][alchemy-link].

[^1]: "We will have to make a classic numerological calculation. We will take our date of birth and add the numbers. The sum of them must be reduced to a single digit. That number is the one that represents our sign in the alchemical horoscope."
