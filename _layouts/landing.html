            You're looking to <a href="#projects">hire him</a>,
            <a href="#">stalk him</a>, <a href="#contact">say "hi"</a>,
            <a href="#settings">mess around a bit with the page</a> or you're
            just hanging out. Either way, you're in the right place.

            Because this page's code is handcrafted Harry decided to do
            something AI would be insane to suggest to me. He can vibe code for
            your projects, if you think that's cool, but he prefers to keep his
            stuff old fashioned.
