            harrypujols.com has been live since way back when Dreamweaver and
            Frontpage was what kids describe today as "code vibing" (though this
            site has always been handcrafted). It's always under destruction,
            construction and deconstruction.

          <p>
            I'm only adding here some fun personal projects. Professional work,
            you know I am not allow to take that code with me, right?

              <a href="https://harrypujols.com/terminal/">Terminal</a> This was
              harrypujols.com from 2014-2024, meant to be only a temporary
              solution until I had time between projects to set up a different
              site. It lasted 10 years (at least one CTO liked it enough to give
              me the job).

              <a href="https://harrypujols.com/desktop/">Desktop</a> This was
              harrypujols.com from 2009-2014 (and the first repo I saved in
              Github). It was originally hosted in some Mac service for static
              sites, I think it was called iTools. My purpose was to make
              something "future proof", and guess what? The Flash version of the
              same idea has been lost in time.

              There are some sites that give you the formula to find your
              alchemy zodiac sign, but this is the only calculator in the Web
              (at the time of this writing). Originally launched in 2018 and
              relaunched in 2021.
